# Sustainability Reflection

This project was designed with sustainability in mind by focusing on long-term data organization, maintainability, and responsible system design.

From a technical perspective, the use of a relational database reduces data redundancy and ensures consistency through well-defined relationships and constraints. This makes the system easier to maintain, extend, and scale over time without introducing unnecessary complexity.

From a social perspective, the application promotes preventive healthcare awareness by helping families track medical history and identify potential hereditary risks early. This supports informed decision-making and encourages proactive health management rather than reactive treatment.

Additionally, the modular phase-based design of the system allows future developers to enhance specific components (such as analytics or awareness content) without redesigning the entire system. This improves maintainability and reduces long-term development effort.

Overall, sustainability in this project is achieved through structured data design, clarity of documentation, and a focus on long-term usability.
