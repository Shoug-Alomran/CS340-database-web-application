## Application Name

**Sillah (صلة) — Preventive Family Health Management System**

---

## Problem Statement

Many families with hereditary health conditions lack a centralized and organized method to:

- Track family medical history consistently  
- Identify potential hereditary risks early  
- Take preventive action based on family-wide patterns  

Health information is often scattered, undocumented, or difficult to analyze over time. As a result, early detection and preventive planning become challenging, particularly for hereditary diseases where risk depends on **patterns across related family members**, not only individual symptoms.

- Linkage to the owning user  

### 3. Medical History Data
- Health conditions  
- Age of onset  
- Severity indicators  
- Association with specific family members  

### 4. Risk Alert Data
- Generated alert records  
- Detection date  
- Description and rationale  
- Status and follow-up tracking  

### 5. Appointment Data
