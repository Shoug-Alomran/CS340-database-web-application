# **CS340 Database Web Application Project**

This project is a full-stack, database-driven web application developed for  
**CS 340 — Introduction to Database Systems**.

The project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of relational database development — from requirements analysis and data modeling to SQL implementation and web-based CRUD operations.

## What This Project Covers

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-database: **Relational Database Design**

    ---
    Conceptual modeling (ER/EER), relational schema mapping, normalization, and integrity constraint enforcement.

-   :material-code-tags: **SQL Implementation**

    ---
    Creation of tables, keys, constraints, and execution of structured queries through backend logic.

-   :material-web: **Full-Stack Integration**

    ---
    Connecting a relational database to a functional web interface supporting CRUD operations.

-   :material-file-document-outline: **Structured Documentation**

    ---
    Phase-based documentation with reproducible design decisions, schema definitions, and implementation details.

</div>

---

## Objectives

- Design a relational database from concept to implementation  
- Enforce entity integrity and referential integrity  
- Implement SQL queries within backend application logic  
- Deliver a fully functional web-based CRUD system  
- Apply structured, phase-based development methodology  

---

## Scope

This project emphasizes **database correctness, integrity enforcement, and system integration** rather than interface complexity.

The focus is on:

- Data modeling accuracy  
- Proper schema design  
- Constraint enforcement  
- Query correctness  
- Clean system architecture  

All development follows structured academic guidelines to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and technical rigor.

## Project Phases

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle: **Phase I — Requirements & Architecture**

    ---
    Define system scope, identify stakeholders, develop usage scenarios, and design the system architecture and UI prototype.

    [Phase I Overview](./Phase-1/)

-   :material-numeric-2-circle: **Phase II — Data Modeling**

    ---
    Develop EER diagrams, relational schemas, normalization, and enforce structural integrity constraints.

    [Phase II Overview](../Phase-2/)

-   :material-numeric-3-circle: **Phase III — Implementation**

    ---
    Implement the database using SQL, integrate with backend logic, and validate data operations.

    [Phase III Overview](../Phase-3/)

-   :material-numeric-4-circle: **Phase IV — Testing & Finalization**

    ---
    Perform validation, query testing, system verification, and final documentation review.

    [Phase IV Overview](../Phase-4/)

## Tools and Technologies

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-database-outline: **Relational Database (MySQL)**

    ---
    Used to implement structured schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

-   :material-language-sql: **SQL**

    ---
    Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

-   :material-web: **Backend + Web Interface**

    ---
    Database-driven CRUD operations executed through application logic.

-   :material-book-open-variant: **MkDocs (Material)**

    ---
    Structured documentation framework for clean, academic project publication.
